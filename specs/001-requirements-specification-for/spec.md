# Feature Specification: EBI - Script Analysis Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-requirements-specification-for`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Ready for Review
**Input**: User description: "Requirements Specification for `ebi` - A command-line utility that intelligently analyzes scripts from standard input using Large Language Models (LLMs) before interactively prompting the user for execution confirmation."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse command-line arguments
   � Separate ebi options from target command and arguments
2. Read script content from stdin
   � If no input: ERROR "No script content provided"
3. Determine script language via priority:
   a. Check for explicit --lang flag
   b. Infer from wrapped command name
   c. Parse shebang from first line
   � If language unknown: ERROR "Cannot determine script language"
4. Parse script with Tree-sitter AST
   � Extract: code logic, comments, string literals
5. Execute parallel LLM analysis:
   � Call A: Analyze comments/strings for prompt injection
   � Call B: Analyze code for functionality/vulnerabilities
6. Aggregate analysis results into report
7. Present report and prompt for confirmation
   � Wait for user input (yes/no)
8. Based on user response:
   � If yes: Pipe original script to target command
   � If no: Terminate gracefully
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a security-conscious developer or system administrator, I want to analyze potentially malicious scripts before execution so that I can prevent unintended damage to my system while still being able to run legitimate scripts when needed.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a bash installation script from the internet, **When** the user pipes it through ebi, **Then** the tool analyzes the script for malicious behavior and asks for confirmation before execution
2. **Given** a Python script with embedded comments, **When** analyzed by ebi, **Then** the tool separately examines comments for prompt injection attempts and code for vulnerabilities
3. **Given** an ambiguous script without language hints, **When** ebi cannot determine the language, **Then** the tool reports an error and does not proceed
4. **Given** a user denies execution after analysis, **When** prompted with yes/no, **Then** the tool terminates without executing the wrapped command
5. **Given** a user confirms execution, **When** prompted with yes/no, **Then** the original unmodified script is passed to the target command

### Edge Cases
- What happens when stdin is empty or contains no content?
- How does system handle unsupported script languages?
- What happens if the LLM service is unavailable or returns errors?
- How does the tool handle extremely large scripts that may exceed LLM token limits?
- What happens when the wrapped command itself doesn't exist or fails?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST intercept and read script content from standard input before passing to target command
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse scripts into separate components: code logic (without comments/literals), comments, and string literals
- **FR-003**: System MUST support multiple scripting languages including at minimum bash and python
- **FR-004**: System MUST perform at least two separate LLM analyses: one for prompt injection detection and one for code vulnerability assessment
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to specify the LLM model via command-line option
- **FR-006**: System MUST automatically detect script language through command inference and shebang parsing when not explicitly specified
- **FR-007**: System MUST present a clear, aggregated analysis report before execution
- **FR-008**: System MUST require explicit user confirmation (yes/no) before executing any script
- **FR-009**: System MUST pass the original, unmodified script to the target command when execution is approved
- **FR-010**: System MUST support passing arbitrary arguments to the wrapped command
- **FR-011**: System MUST block script execution when LLM service is unavailable or returns errors (fail-safe approach)
- **FR-012**: System MUST support configurable timeout for LLM analysis (default: 60 seconds, range: 10-300 seconds) via `--timeout` flag
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle scripts exceeding LLM token limits by prioritizing analysis of security-critical code sections (entry points, external commands, network operations)
- **FR-014**: System MAY support `--verbose` flag for detailed processing information and `--debug` flag for complete debugging output including LLM communications

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Performance targets are best-effort based on LLM response times (no specific benchmarks)
- **NFR-002**: Security whitelist/blacklist features are deferred to future versions based on user feedback
- **NFR-003**: Logging is disabled by default for privacy; enabled via `--verbose` or `--debug` flags only

### Key Entities
- **Script**: The input content to be analyzed, containing code in a specific programming language
- **Analysis Report**: The aggregated result of all LLM analyses, presenting findings about security risks, functionality, and recommendations
- **Language Context**: The determined programming language and its associated parsing rules
- **Script Components**: The three extracted parts - code logic, comments, and string literals
- **Execution Context**: The target command and its arguments that will receive the script
